Week-1
Started with the basics of python i learnt about the various opertation in python, data types and data structures in python. Condition and loops,function declaration , reccurssive function and the most important thing module & packages and some standard libraries ( eg: import math as m ). After this i studied about classes and object in python ( quite confusing at times ) and then ended the week with an assignment.

Week-2
The most interesting week for python, this week covered topics from scientific use of python. Started the week with some basic( and more than enough ) data science libraries, such as Numpy
covering which is mainly used for handling and creating multi-dimensional arrays. Pandas includes arranging the data in data frame format which helps in ease of infering from the data and accessing them.Matplotlib , it is a data visualisation library and 2-D plotting library of python.Seaborn , it consist of bunch of data set for practicing and understanding.Scikit-learn helps in writing code primarily in machine learning.Application of finance , starting with algo trading which helps in feeding patterns to the code and then making use of it for making maximum profit. Mean reversion , the stock price tends to move in the direction of average price over time so we can buy and sell any stock in accordance with that.

Week-3
Intro to ML( machine learning ) is a field where we give some inputs to the computer and expect some usefull outcomes from it. Supervised learning , here we take all the past year data points with the help of that we design a linear model ( linear regression ) to predict the upcoming events. Unsupervised learning , where we dont have any past data set but even then we try to predict the upcoming events.
